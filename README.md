# ud862: Project 5: Make Your App Material

#Project Overview
In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. XYZ Reader is a mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and shocking headlines! The goal is to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.
